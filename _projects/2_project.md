## Project Overview

A human voice recognition system implemented using feed-forward neural networks for voice-based platforms. The system processes audio signals using advanced deep learning techniques to accurately recognize and classify human voices.

## Key Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**: Feed-forward neural networks for classification
- **Audio Processing**: Python 3 with NumPy/Librosa for Digital Signal Processing
- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch/TensorFlow integration
- **Feature Extraction**: MFCC and FBANK features for audio analysis

## Technical Implementation

The system extracts MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and FBANK features from audio signals and uses them to train feed-forward neural networks. The model is capable of recognizing different voices with high accuracy.

## Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: High classification accuracy
- **F1-Score**: Balanced precision and recall
- **EER (Equal Error Rate)**: Superior performance compared to traditional voice recognition methods

## Applications

- Voice-based authentication systems
- Speech recognition platforms
- Voice-controlled applications
- Audio classification systems
