## Project Overview

A computer vision project focused on detecting cotton wool spots in retinal images for early detection of diabetic retinopathy. This technology helps identify diabetic retinopathy at an early stage, a major cause of vision loss in diabetic patients.

## Key Features

- **Image Processing**: Advanced image processing techniques for retinal image analysis
- **Machine Learning**: ML algorithms for cotton wool spot detection
- **Computer Vision**: Automated identification of pathological features
- **Medical Imaging**: Fundus image analysis and classification

## Technical Implementation

The project employs image processing and machine learning techniques to identify and classify cotton wool spots in fundus images. The system can automatically detect signs of diabetic retinopathy from retinal photographs.

## Clinical Significance

- Early detection of diabetic retinopathy
- Automated screening tool for healthcare providers
- Non-invasive diagnostic method
- High accuracy in detecting pathological features

## Impact

This project contributes to improving healthcare accessibility by providing an automated screening tool for diabetic retinopathy, potentially helping prevent vision loss in diabetic patients.
