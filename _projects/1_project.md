## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Smart Battery Management System (BMS) for portable devices using deep learning techniques to enhance battery life and performance. The system employs machine learning models to accurately estimate State of Charge (SoC), State of Health (SoH), and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: Built using Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- **Accurate Predictions**: State of Charge (SoC), State of Health (SoH), and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation
- **High Performance**: Evaluation metrics showed clear improvements over traditional BMS methods
- **Evaluation Metrics**: MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² for comprehensive performance analysis

## Technical Implementation

The project implements advanced deep learning algorithms to predict battery parameters with high accuracy. The system processes real-time battery data and provides insights that help optimize battery usage and extend battery life.

## Results

The deep learning models demonstrated significant improvements over traditional Battery Management System methods, achieving high accuracy in predicting critical battery parameters.

## Publication

This research was published in the International Journal of Innovative Research in Technology (IJIRT), Volume 10 Issue 11, April 2024.
