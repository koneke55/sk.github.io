I am **Sambou KONE**, a passionate Data Scientist and AI researcher with a dual Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Electronics & Communication from Jain University, Bangalore, where I graduated as **Batch Topper with a CGPA of 3.64/4.00**.

## Current Roles

**Co-Founder & CTO** at Super DataInsights & AI Scientists Innovations (Bamako, Mali)  
Leading research and development initiatives focusing on vision-language models to extend AI capabilities by combining text and image analysis for deeper multimodal understanding. My work involves IoT and AI/ML research, with emphasis on Computer Vision Algorithms including Vision Transformers (ViT) and DTFR. I'm actively working towards publishing academic papers in these cutting-edge fields.

**Data Analyst** at ObjectWays Technologies - Chennai, India (Remote)  
Working on the Amex Speech-to-Text (SST) annotation project, I specialize in processing French CCP (Customer Care) and CM (Card Member) interactions. My responsibilities include:
- Cleaning and pre-processing Speech-to-Text transcript files
- BigQuery SQL and ETL processing (Dataform, Cloud Data Fusion, Apache Beam)
- Data insights collection for ML accuracy testing using Speech-To-Text (STT•French)
- Utilizing NLP tools: vTensorAct Studio, Amazon SageMaker, and Encord
- **Achieved 90% accuracy** for monitoring user (Card Member) and Customer Care Personnel (CCP) interactions for banking service quality improvement

## Research Interests

My research spans **Quantum Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **Multimodal Computing**, and **Vision-Language Models**. I'm currently focused on:
- Extending AI capabilities through text and image analysis for multimodal understanding
- Computer Vision Algorithms (Vision Transformers, DTFR)
- Smart Battery Management Systems for portable devices and autonomous vehicles
- Deep learning applications in embedded systems and real-time intelligent systems
- Speech-to-text and human voice recognition systems
