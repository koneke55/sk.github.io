  abstract={This paper presents a smart battery management system for portable devices using deep learning techniques to enhance battery life. The research employs machine learning models built in Python using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow to estimate State of Charge (SoC), State of Health (SoH), and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) with high accuracy. Evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared metrics showed significant improvements over traditional Battery Management System methods.}
